      <h2><i className="fas fa-lock"></i> Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
      <p>At Flightsnapp, we're all about safeguarding your privacy like a hidden gem retreat—it's the cornerstone of our mission to curate those hyper-personalized, one-of-a-kind YOLO escapes! We commit to collecting only the must-have data to spin our hybrid AI magic, delivering 5-star travel recommendations without snagging any personally identifiable info unless you choose to share it. Dive deeper into our <a href="/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2><i className="fas fa-info-circle"></i> 1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We're laser-focused on essentials to tailor your dream snaps, so here's what we gather:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quiz Responses:</strong> Your fun answers to our Big 5 personality quiz let us decode your unique traits (like high Openness for bold adventures or low Neuroticism for chill retreats) and serve up personalized recommendations via our rule-based filters and ML personalization.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> We scoop up device details, IP addresses, and usage stats to fine-tune site performance, ensure seamless spins, and boost your overall experience—like optimizing for random deal discoveries or group package matches.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We skip the basics like your name, email, or any direct IDs unless you voluntarily ping us (e.g., for beta access or support). No fuss, just fun curation!</p>

    <section className="policy-section">
      <h2><i className="fas fa-cogs"></i> 2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>Your quiz insights fuel our hybrid curator to craft travel playlists that reflect your personality, dreams, and spontaneity—think adventure spins for extraverts or budget-conscious getaways for conscientious types. Technical data helps us maintain a rock-solid platform, squash bugs, and enhance features like flexible date searches or real-time affiliate integrations (e.g., with Amadeus for flights or Tiqets for activities). We stick strictly to these joyful purposes—no detours!</p>

    <section className="policy-section">
      <h2><i className="fas fa-share-alt"></i> 3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
      <p>Flightsnapp doesn't currently sell, trade, or share your data for marketing mischief or anything shady—your privacy is our VIP guest! If you opt in (totally your call!), we might use anonymized quiz trends to level up our AI algorithms, ensuring zero ties back to you while making future snaps even more magical for everyone. We may update our data practices in the future, but we'll always notify you via policy changes and prioritize transparency. Otherwise, data stays locked in our ecosystem, with partners like Stripe (for payouts) or Grok API (for uniqueness scans) bound by strict confidentiality to keep things secure and fun.</p>

    <section className="policy-section">
      <h2><i className="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> 4. Data Security Measures</h2>
      <p>We guard your data with top-tier encryption and robust defenses, like a fortress around your favorite secret spot—protecting against unauthorized access, tweaks, or leaks. Our industry-standard practices ensure your quiz vibes and tech footprints stay safe as we curate those spontaneous, 5-star escapes.</p>
    </section>
    <section className="policy-section">
      <h2><i className="fas fa-user-shield"></i> 5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>No clunky accounts needed—your Flightsnapp journey is streamlined and hassle-free, just like our one-tap Snaps! If you've got questions or want us to zap any session-linked data (e.g., anonymized quiz responses), hit us up at <a href="mailto:flightsnapp@gmail.com">flightsnapp@gmail.com</a>. Under laws like GDPR or CCPA, you can access, correct, or delete info, withdraw consent for optional uses, or object to processing—we're here to make it easy and empower your control!</p>
    </section>
    <section className="policy-section">
      <h2><i className="fas fa-clock"></i> 6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We hold onto quiz responses and tech data only as long as needed to deliver your personalized magic (like matching high Extraversion squads to lively group packages) or meet legal musts—then it's securely wiped or anonymized. Short and sweet, so we can focus on fresh spins for your next adventure!</p>
    </section>
    <section className="policy-section">
      <h2><i className="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> 7. Policy Updates</h2>
      <p>We'll tweak this Privacy Policy as our platform evolves (think new affiliate vibes or ML upgrades), posting changes here with a fresh effective date. Swing by periodically to stay in the loop—we'll keep it transparent and fun, just like our random deal discoveries! We may change our data practices at any time, but we'll always notify you of material updates to ensure your vibes stay aligned.</p>
