        <h1>SnappStars Program Agreement</h1>
        <hr />
        <p><strong>Version 1.1 | Effective Date:</strong> August 26, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Prepared by:</strong> Flightsnapp Legal & Strategy Team</p>
        <section className="policy-section">
          <h2><i className="fas fa-handshake"></i> Introduction</h2>
          <p>This Agreement outlines the terms and conditions for participation in the SnappStars program ("Program"), operated by Flightsnapp, Inc. ("Flightsnapp"). The Program enables qualified Stars to list unique properties and experiences, integrating them into Flightsnapp's AI-powered travel curation platform. By participating, Stars agree to these terms, which are designed to foster profitable, scalable partnerships while delivering hyper-personalized, one-of-a-kind travel experiences for Millennials and Gen Z users.</p>
          <p>Flightsnapp's vision is to empower intuitive, joyful travel like a vacation playlist—curating spontaneous, 5-star trips reflecting users' personalities via Big 5 psychology quizzes, hybrid AI curation (rule-based filters for budgets/dates and ML for persona matching), random "slot machine" spins for deals, and group packages for similar vibes. SnappStars fuels this by providing exclusive listings blended with affiliates (e.g., Amadeus flights, Tiqets activities) for seamless, one-tap "Snaps."</p>
          <p>This Agreement is binding upon approval of a Star's application. Flightsnapp reserves the right to amend terms with 15 days' notice. Consult legal counsel for personalized advice.</p>

          <h2><i className="fas fa-info-circle"></i> 1. Program Overview</h2>
          <h3>Program Description</h3>
          <p>SnappStars allows individuals, influencers, and small operators ("Stars") to apply and list exclusive properties and experiences on Flightsnapp. Listings must be unique and verified, such as off-grid cabins for conscientious budgeters or urban adventures for extraverts.

          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>The Program enhances Flightsnapp's one-stop shop for YOLO-style escapes, driving viral growth through high-quality, personalized curation. Stars benefit from exposure to tech-savvy users, automated bookings, and competitive payouts, while Flightsnapp monetizes via commissions and subscriptions.</p>
